🖐️🎚️ Hand Gesture Volume Control using OpenCV + ML
Control your system volume like a wizard using just your hand gestures — no mouse, no keyboard, just Jedi-level vibes 🤘😎

Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw, this project lets you use your webcam to detect hand gestures and control your system's volume in real time!

🚀 Features
  📷 Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe
  
  🎚️ Thumb–index finger distance adjusts system volume
  
  🔕 Smooth & stable volume control — no flickering!
  
  ⛔ Press 'q' or 'ESC' to exit (keyboard-based fallback included)
  
  👌 Super fun, hands-free way to impress your tech friends

🧠 How It Works
  The webcam captures your hand using OpenCV.
  
  MediaPipe tracks your thumb tip and index finger tip.
  
  The distance between them is calculated.
  
  That distance is mapped to your system volume range using pycaw.
  
  Move your fingers = change volume. Keep still = volume holds steady.
